# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

By taking the data we were given initially by V. Isualize and manipulating it into a more readable and useful format, we can use the data to determine ride-sharing tendencies (particularly fares and trip volume) down to a weekly level over the course of four months to better understand just how often ride-sharing is implemented and how much money it brings in based on the following settings: rural cities, suburban cities, and urban cities. 

## Results

By breaking the data down into city "types" rather than per individual city, we were able to determine some corolations between the type of city and the prevelance of ride-sharing. If we look at the following graph, we will see the total fares for each city type over the course of a four-month period:
