# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

By taking the data we were given initially by V. Isualize and manipulating it into a more readable and useful format, we can use the data to determine ride-sharing tendencies (particularly fares and trip volume) down to a weekly level over the course of four months to better understand just how often ride-sharing is implemented and how much money it brings in based on the following settings: rural cities, suburban cities, and urban cities. 

## Results

By breaking the data down into city "types" rather than per individual city, we were able to determine some corolations between the type of city and the prevelance of ride-sharing. If we look at the following graph, we will see the total fares for each city type over the course of a four-month period:

As one might expected, the more population dense urban cities yielded much higher total fares than the less populated suburban and rural cities. However, if we look at the following chart: 

![Average Fare vs Number of Rides by City Type](https://github.com/BPeaver/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer%20Challenge/Analysis/Fig1.png)

We can see that urban cities had significantly higher numbers of rides, but lower average fare prices. In contrast, rural areas saw the inverse: higher average fares but less frequent usage; with suburban cities occupying a middle ground between the two in terms of total trips and fare pricing. 

A few of things could explain this:
  1: Population density naturally leads to increased ride volume. A rural area would have fewer total rides simply based on less people to book rides.
  2: The compact nature of urban settings allows for shorter rides, and thus lower fares. Suburban and rural cities have a lower population density and more sprawl to them,          which extends the distance between where a traveler is and where they want to go. 
  3: Higher fares are a natural deterent to people wanting to book rides, while a lower and "less inconvenient" fare makes a consumer more likely to use the service often. 
  
## Summary

Based on the results of this analysis, we can offer 3 recommendations to the CEO of PyBer:
  
  1: Look into reducing the average fare price for rural settings per trip. A communal ride-share program, for instance, to ferry people from rural communites to jobs in more      suburban or urban settings and allowing people to share the same Pyber and thus pool the cost of fare money
  2: Continue, and possibly increase, marketing and presence in urban areas. This is where the most money is coming in, and there are several ride-share companies out there        now. Make sure you are first in the consumers mind.
  3: Explore creating a sort of "PyBer Elite" sort of program, possibly a monthly subscription or reloadable account on the app that gives frequent users ride credits,              discounts, promotions at popular retail outlets, etc. This will incentivize the consumer to use PyBer over commpetitors, as people are often drawn to these types of            prommotions because they percieve "getting back" from the company.
